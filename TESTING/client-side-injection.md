### XSS :
- identify all user fields withing the application
- inject them with data and see where the input is reflected
- identify the context of the input
- identify how to break out of the context
- identify the compensating controls the application uses to defend against malicious input
  (client side validation - cookie flags - WAF - content security policy - server side validation - output encoding )
- try different payloads that bypass these defense mechanisms
